Time to add inside candle spotter. 
Need to use helper_customStrategyUpdate and have inside candle return an output

I should eventually allow the program to not rely on the 1 min chart. 
Think I found a bug. Its not drawing anything above the inside candles. 
Found the bug: inside candle args.current_candle.bar_index alwasy = 0. 
Fixed the problems within the inside candle library, but now theres still something wrong. 
Maybe we are just returning the wrong timeframe.
