Time to add inside candle spotter. 
Need to use helper_customStrategyUpdate and have inside candle return an output

I should eventually allow the program to not rely on the 1 min chart. 
Think I found a bug. Its not drawing anything above the inside candles. 
Found the bug: inside candle args.current_candle.bar_index alwasy = 0. 
Fixed the problems within the inside candle library, but now theres still something wrong. 
Maybe we are just returning the wrong timeframe. 
I need to have an array that keeps track of n cancles back. 

We are adding FVG correctly but not drawing it. NOw need to filter out FVGs that are too old. 
Higher time frame candles aren't coming out right in live replay mode:

Make MultiTimeFrameLibrary work on non 1 min chart: 

    step 1: Make is so that if we add a timeframe thats above the current script timeframe, it doesnt work: 
    keep track of script timeframe. Done. 
    Need to make it so that we can print better the candles. We have a higher tf and an entry tf. 
    How can we tell if we have an entry thats touchinga higher tf thing. 
    How can we print multiple candle tfs. 
    For now lets just have an option for print higher tf candles, and print entry tf candles:
    Done. Now lets add an option to print out higher tf and entry fvgs.  
    Time to fix the FVG library. It can accept inside candles sometimes. 
    What if we make it so we only take in one inside candle. 
    That would still mess up the order I think tho. But then we have to replace it when we break out. 
        *We hit an inside candle: if its the first one process it. Add it as most recent. 
        When we breakout: replace the inside candle. Make sure middle candle isn't inside candle or outside candle .

        I know the bug. We are storing multiple Inside Infos. They are all to the same pointer so when we change one we change them all. 
        Lets make it so we can toggle print candle info: 

TODO: make it so one drawing can have multiple boxes / labels.

Now lets add a variable to keep track of if we are inside an FVG. 
Need to find out why this inside FVG vairiable is having false alarms. 
Its because we need to filter out that we are not the candle right after. 
Okay now I want to make it so we can add an additional marking to a candle. 
There is a delay when we use plot shape. We need to modify the actual candle drawings. Lets just add a label type shit. 

Need a function to delete finished drawings. 
Lets add a minimum FVG size: (in usd)

I think there is going to be a problem when we try to use the 2 min entries and see if they are in a 7m FVG. 
 
Maybe we should process the FVGs on the script candle timeline. 
Or at least we need to process them on the entry level timeline. 

Ideally, we keep a list of all the active FVGs. 
Or honestly to avoid all that bs, we should just process the data on the lowest level script timeline. 
We will only process FVGs with the script level timelime: 
Okay, now how do I store that a 2 min candle reaches a 7 min fvg. 
That doesnt even work. Whats the best way to do this: 

Maybe we just have a fucntion in FVG lib for does candle overlap FVG. 
OKay now its time to put this to the test.
