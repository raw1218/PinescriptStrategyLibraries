Time to add key levels. 
Lets keep track of the key levels and their names. They can be updated.
Lets make its own library. 

How will it work. 
Each key level just has its own name and stuff. 

Lets first implement only taking a trade if it touches a key level. 

Now lets add another type of trade, taking profit when it hits a key level. 
Need to add some logic to the strategy entyr library to not take a set R. To Take a Variable R. 

Whats the best way to do this. Need a way to set the RR of the rule at each candle. 
Ideally will use a Risk Reward library? 

Can have an entry type that just says take nearest key level, but want to generalize and be able to just honestly pass in the RR (or target)

Forget about mantaining a separate library. 
Lets just think about the best way to update the target of a trade. 

Okay I added Exit Actions to the library, now implement the actual strategy:

    On a key level = 1R. 
    To a key level = that many R.
