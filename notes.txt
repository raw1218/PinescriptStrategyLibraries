Time to add inside candle spotter. 
Need to use helper_customStrategyUpdate and have inside candle return an output

I should eventually allow the program to not rely on the 1 min chart. 
Think I found a bug. Its not drawing anything above the inside candles. 
Found the bug: inside candle args.current_candle.bar_index alwasy = 0. 
Fixed the problems within the inside candle library, but now theres still something wrong. 
Maybe we are just returning the wrong timeframe. 
I need to have an array that keeps track of n cancles back. 

We are adding FVG correctly but not drawing it. NOw need to filter out FVGs that are too old. 
Higher time frame candles aren't coming out right in live replay mode:

    How can we print multiple candle tfs. 
    For now lets just have an option for print higher tf candles, and print entry tf candles:
