Time to add inside candle spotter. 
Need to use helper_customStrategyUpdate and have inside candle return an output

I should eventually allow the program to not rely on the 1 min chart. 
Think I found a bug. Its not drawing anything above the inside candles. 
Found the bug: inside candle args.current_candle.bar_index alwasy = 0. 
Fixed the problems within the inside candle library, but now theres still something wrong. 
Maybe we are just returning the wrong timeframe. 
I need to have an array that keeps track of n cancles back. 

We are adding FVG correctly but not drawing it. NOw need to filter out FVGs that are too old. 
Higher time frame candles aren't coming out right in live replay mode:

Make MultiTimeFrameLibrary work on non 1 min chart: 

    step 1: Make is so that if we add a timeframe thats above the current script timeframe, it doesnt work: 
    keep track of script timeframe. Done. 
    Need to make it so that we can print better the candles. We have a higher tf and an entry tf. 
    How can we tell if we have an entry thats touchinga higher tf thing. 
    How can we print multiple candle tfs. 
    For now lets just have an option for print higher tf candles, and print entry tf candles:
    Done. Now lets add an option to print out higher tf and entry fvgs.  
    Time to fix the FVG library. It can accept inside candles sometimes. 
    What if we make it so we only take in one inside candle. 
    That would still mess up the order I think tho. But then we have to replace it when we break out. 
        *We hit an inside candle: if its the first one process it. Add it as most recent. 
        When we breakout: replace the inside candle. Make sure middle candle isn't inside candle or outside candle .

        I know the bug. We are storing multiple Inside Infos. They are all to the same pointer so when we change one we change them all. 
        Lets make it so we can toggle print candle info: 

TODO: make it so one drawing can have multiple boxes / labels.
